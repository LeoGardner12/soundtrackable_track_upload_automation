The soundtrackable_track_upload_automation project was written to automate the process of embedding meta data, coverting and uploading many tracks in the form of wav files to https://soundtrackable.com/tracks/ where the result of the script can be seen.
wav_to_website.py is the script which calls all of the functions written in the other files.
the all_tracks folder containing all the .wav files hasnt been inclued as these are products which need to be purchased.
